DESCRIPTION :
Introduction
Compiler design is a fundamental concept in computer science that focuses on translating high-level programming languages into machine code that a computer can execute. This project aims to provide a structured understanding of compiler basics, covering key components such as lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, intermediate code generation, optimization, and final code generation. The project is designed to help learners grasp essential compilation processes, making it useful for students, researchers, and developers working with programming languages.

Project Overview
This project focuses on implementing a basic compiler framework that processes source code through various compilation stages. The core objectives include:

Lexical Analysis – Tokenizing the input program.
Syntax Analysis – Constructing a parse tree based on grammar rules.
Semantic Analysis – Checking for logical consistency and type correctness.
Intermediate Code Generation – Converting code into an abstract representation.
Optimization – Improving efficiency by reducing unnecessary operations.
Code Generation – Producing final executable code.
Each module is implemented independently to ensure modularity and clarity. The project uses C or Python for implementation, with a structured approach to parsing and processing input code.
